"""Your GitHub profile — cached, because it sits on the critical path.

`GET /api/profile` is requested by the Topbar, so it renders on *every* page of the
app. It used to call `GET https://api.github.com/user` inline on each request, which
put a live third-party round trip between you and your first paint, and burned a
rate-limit unit doing it. The profile changes at most a few times a year.

So it is stored in a small `meta` collection and served from there. A read is a
single `_id` lookup against a database the API is already talking to. GitHub is
consulted only when the cached copy is missing or older than `PROFILE_TTL`, and a
failed refresh returns the stale copy rather than an error: a rate limit or a GitHub
outage should not blank out the avatar in the header.
